# MODCODE can be found in the steam page URL of the mod
# steamdb.info can help

# Link mod
ln -sT MODS/MODCODE ARMA/mods/MODNAME
# MODNAME is arbitrary, but must be unique.
# Make it all lowercase letters :|

# Load keys
cp MODS/MODCODE/$(ls -1 MODS/MODCODE | grep -i key)/* ARMA/keys
# There doesn't seem to be a standard among key keys Key or Keys.
# grep -i should grabs the right folder name.

# Build the modline
-mod="mods/MODNAME;mods/MODNAME1;mods/MODNAME2"
# Disable mods by removhing them from this line
# With only one mod it would look like -mod="mods/MODNAME"

# Verify file name normalization
# Look at MODS/MODCODE/addons
# If the server fails to run, try making these files lower case.
# The server should throw an error that indicates these files are the issue.
